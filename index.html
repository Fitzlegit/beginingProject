    <h1>Wedding Crashers</h1>

    <h2>A classic comedy</h2>

    <p>
        Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) and John (Owen Wilson) are divorce mediators who spend their free time crashing wedding receptions. 
        For the irrepressible duo, there are few better ways to drink for free and bed vulnerable women. 
        So when Secretary of the Treasury William Cleary (Christopher Walken) announces the wedding of his daughter, 
        the pair make it their mission to crash the high-profile event. 
        But their game hits a bump in the road when John locks eyes with bridesmaid Claire (Rachel McAdams).
